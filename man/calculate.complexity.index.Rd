\title{Calculate Complexity Index}
\usage{
calculate.complexity.index(spectra)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{Spectral signatures of fluorophores, normalized between 0
and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors (channels) in columns. More
than one spectra are needed to calculate anything here.}
}
\value{
The complexity index (condition number) for the spectral flow
cytometry panel.
}
